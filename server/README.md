# Express Server

## Getting Started

After clonning the repo, install dependecies.

```shell
npm install
```

Then, copy the .env.example file to a file named .env, and then edit it to fill in the details. Add your RPC url as well as the address of the Dex and TestTokenDex contracts. With a valid .env file in place, you can strart the dev server:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```shell
npm run build
```

Run in prod mode:

```shell
npm run start
```
